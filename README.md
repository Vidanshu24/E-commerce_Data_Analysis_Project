##  Project Overview

This is an end-to-end **Data Analyst portfolio project** that demonstrates how SQL and Python can be combined to answer real-world business questions.

###  Tools Used

* **MySQL** – to store data and execute complex SQL queries
* **Python** – to connect with the database and process query results
* **Pandas & NumPy** – data manipulation and analysis
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** – clean, step-by-step analytical workflow

##  Business Questions Answered

The analysis answers several key ecommerce-related business questions, including:

* What are all the **unique cities** customers are from?
* How many **orders were placed in 2017**?
* What is the **total sales per product category**?
